<h1 class="genre">Welcome to Adventure Alley!</h1>
<p class="body">Have you ever been reading a story and wished you could help
the main character make their decisions? Here at Adventure Alley,
you can do exactly that! This is a choose-your-own-adventure website 
where your choices guide the story. Start your journey by picking 
an adventure from one of our four categories. As you read, you’ll 
make decisions that shape the characters’ paths and determine their endings.</p>

<h1 class="genre" ><a href="The Christmas Crashout/CCOAbout.html">Humor</a></h1>
<h2 class="title">The Christmas Crash Out</h2>
<p class="body">The holidays are supposed to be cheerful… but in your family, 
they’re a battlefield. As the youngest, you’re the prime target
for prying questions, passive-aggressive comments, and unsolicited 
life advice from every direction. This year, you’ve decided you’re 
done being the quiet one. Armed with snark, strategy, and a mission to
become the ultimate comeback king or queen, you’ll navigate dinner disasters, 
nosy relatives, and awkward gift exchanges. Every choice you make will shape
whether you leave the celebration victorious—or hide in the bathroom until dessert.</p>

<h1 class="genre"><a href="Will I Ever Get To Say Goodbye/WIEGTSGBAbout.html">Romantic Tragedy</a></h1>
<h2 class="title">Will I Ever Get to Say Goodbye</h2>
<p class="body">When Adelyn moves into her new apartment, she’s expecting a 
fresh start not an unexpected connection. Then she meets him: 
her mysterious, kind, impossibly charming neighbor who seems to 
carry a heavy sadness behind his smile. What she doesn’t know is 
that his time is running out, and everything between them is unfolding
against the ticking clock of fate. As Adelyn grows closer to him, you’ll
guide her choices whether she pushes forward, pulls away, or uncovers truths 
she never saw coming. Your decisions may give her the chance to say goodbye… or
leave her with a heartbreak she never prepared for.</p>

<h1 class="genre"><a href="Gone With The Crust/gonewiththecrustintro.html">Mystery</a></h1>
<h2 class="title">Gone With the Crust</h2>
 <p class="body">The state fair is buzzing with excitement, and Valerie’s legendary
 blueberry pies are set to be the star of the baking competition until
 disaster strikes. Every last pie has vanished without a trace. Enter Detective
 Charlie: sharp-eyed, sharp-witted, and determined to crack the case before the
 judging begins. With a growing list of suspects, from jealous competitors to
 mischievous fair performers, you’ll help Charlie investigate clues, interrogate
 witnesses, and uncover hidden motives. Can you piece together the truth before the
 culprit slips away… or worse, wins first place with stolen pastries?</p>

<h1 class="genre"><a href="LGBTQ DATE/about.html">LGBTQ Romance</a></h1>
<h2 h2 class="title">A Night to Remember</h2>
<p class="body">For the first time in your life, you’ve fallen for a woman and 
tonight is the night you finally get to take her out. Butterflies? Absolutely.
A million worries about messing it up? Definitely. As Emily, you’ll step into an
evening filled with possibilities: sparks of chemistry, unexpected twists, heartfelt 
conversations, and choices that could turn a simple date into a life-changing moment. 
Will nerves get the best of you, or will this night become the beginning of something 
extraordinary? Your decisions shape every moment and every heartbeat.</p>
