Checking For Witnesses...
</p><br>
<p class="body">
I moved through the streets, looking for anyone who might have seen something, anyone who could give me a fragment of the story.
People shuffled past, heads down, pretending to mind their own business.
Some glanced back, eyes fleeting, wary, guilty even if they hadn’t done a thing.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
I noted the footprints in the dust,
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
A kid with flour on his shoes,
</p><br>
<p class="body">
A delivery man walking too fast,
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
A jogger pausing by the booth.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
Each one told a story, some true, some exaggerated by memory, some completely invented.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
The witnesses were all fragments, pieces of glass I had to fit into a picture I couldn’t yet see.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
A neighbor who remembered a shadow,
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
A security guard half-asleep on his post,
</p><br> 
<p class="body">
A dog barking at nothing, 
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Each one layered on the next, messy, confusing, but necessary.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
I let them speak with their silence, watching, remembering, piecing together the invisible threads.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
The truth doesn’t always announce itself with a bang.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
Sometimes it waits in the hesitation of an old man on a park bench, the nervous glance of a child, the shuffle of feet.
And sometimes it whispers in flour dust that clings to shoes like a guilty conscience.
</p><br>
<p class="bod1y">
I collected the pieces, one by one, like fragments of an unsolved puzzle.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
And I knew the thief, whoever they were, had left a trail.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
A trail just narrow enough to make me think I was chasing nothing, and just wide enough to let me catch them if I kept my eyes open.
