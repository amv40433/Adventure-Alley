<h1>Checking For Witnesses</h1>
<p>I moved through the streets, looking for anyone who might have seen something, anyone who could give me a fragment of the story.
 People shuffled past, heads down, pretending to mind their own business.
 Some glanced back, eyes fleeting, wary, guilty even if they hadn’t done a thing.
 <br>
I noted the footprints in the dust,
 <br>
A kid with flour on his shoes,
 <br>
 A delivery man walking too fast
  <br>
 A jogger pausing by the booth.
  <br>
 Each one told a story, some true, some exaggerated by memory, some completely invented.
  <br>
The witnesses were all fragments, pieces of glass I had to fit into a picture I couldn’t yet see.
 <br>
 A neighbor who remembered a shadow
  <br>
 A security guard half-asleep on his post,
   <br> 
 A dog barking at nothing, 
   <br>
Each one layered on the next, messy, confusing, but necessary.
    <br>
I let them speak with their silence, watching, remembering, piecing together the invisible threads.
 <br>
 The truth doesn’t always announce itself with a bang.
  <br>
 Sometimes it waits in the hesitation of an old man on a park bench, the nervous glance of a child, the shuffle of feet.
 And sometimes it whispers in flour dust that clings to shoes like a guilty conscience.
  <br>
I collected the pieces, one by one, like fragments of an unsolved puzzle.
 <br>
 And I knew the thief — whoever they were — had left a trail.
  <br>
 A trail just narrow enough to make me think I was chasing nothing, and just wide enough to let me catch them if I kept my eyes open.
