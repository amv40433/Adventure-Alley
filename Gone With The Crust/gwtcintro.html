<h1>Gone With The Crust</h1>
<p>It was August 3rd, 2025,
<br>
I’d been working this case for 4 hours, and somehow felt no closer to cracking it than when I started.
<br>
 The coffee was cold, the cigarette burned down to the filter, and my patience was hanging on by a thread.
 <br>
 They don’t tell you this part in the academy
 <br>
 The waiting,
 <br>
 The circling,
 <br>
 The sinking feeling that you’re chasing ghosts in a town full of them.
 <br>
 But that’s the job.
 <br>
 My job.
 <br>
 <br>
 The case started with a blood-curdling scream from one Mrs. Valerie Crumb. She had dropped her award-winning shepherd's pies off at the contest booth late last night for judging later this afternoon, but when she returned to check on them this morning, all that was left was an empty pie tin.
<br>
 Seemed simple at first — they always do.
 <br>
 I should’ve walked away.
 <br>
 Any wise man would’ve.
 <br>
 But I’m not smart —
 <br>
 I’m stubborn.
 <br>
 And the city… Well, she knows how to keep a man on a leash.</p>
