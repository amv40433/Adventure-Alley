<main class="main">
<p class="body">
The feed flickered, black-and-white ghosts moving in slow, jerky rhythm.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Frames captured the night: empty streets, closed shops, the contest booth in eerie silence.
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
And then… 
</p><br>
<p class="body">
The shadow moved.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Hands? 
</p><br>
<p class="body">
No. 
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Feet? 
</p><br> 
<p class="body">
Not exactly.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
It wasn’t a thief at all.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
It was something smaller, faster, and far more unpredictable.
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
A dog!
</p><br>
<p class="body">
One of the farmer’s, apparently loose last night, bounded through the booth.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Sniffed, circled, and then attacked the prize like a furry hurricane.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
The pies didn’t stand a chance.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
They were gone in seconds.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
The crust, the filling, the glory, devoured, destroyed, and the tin licked clean like it had never held anything at all.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
I leaned back in my chair, the cigarette burning down to nothing.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
So this was the criminal mastermind: four paws, a wagging tail, and zero sense of fairness.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
The city had thrown its weight into a drama, and the villain turned out to be… a dog.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
I laughed, low, dry, and empty, because there was nothing else to do.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
All the chasing, the canvassing, the careful note-taking, the flour trails, the shadows, the tension…
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
For a pie.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
But that’s life in this city.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Sometimes the answers are too absurd to be believable.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
Sometimes the thief isn’t clever, isn’t careful, or isn't human at all.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Valerie would be furious, sure.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
And Revera… probably relieved.
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
But me?
</p><br>
<p class="body">
I just shook my head.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
The city never stops surprising you.
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
And neither do its dogs.
