<h1>Who Done It?</h1>
<p>The feed flickered, black-and-white ghosts moving in slow, jerky rhythm.
    <br>
 Frames captured the night: empty streets, closed shops, the contest booth in eerie silence.
 <br>
 And then… 
 <br>
 the shadow moved.
 <br>
Hands? 
<br>
No. 
<br>
Feet? 
<br> 
Not exactly.
<br>
 It wasn’t a thief at all.
 <br>
 It was something smaller, faster, and far more unpredictable.
 <br>
A dog!
<br>
One of the farmer’s, apparently loose last night, bounded through the booth.
<br>
 Sniffed, circled, and then attacked the prize like a furry hurricane.
 <br>
 The pies didn’t stand a chance.
 <br>
 They were gone in seconds.
 <br>
 The crust, the filling, the glory, devoured, destroyed, and the tin licked clean like it had never held anything at all.
 <br>
 <br>
I leaned back in my chair, the cigarette burning down to nothing.
<br>
 So this was the criminal mastermind: four paws, a wagging tail, and zero sense of fairness.
 <br>
 The city had thrown its weight into a drama, and the villain turned out to be… a dog.
 <br>
I laughed, low, dry, and empty, because there was nothing else to do.
<br>
 All the chasing, the canvassing, the careful note-taking, the flour trails, the shadows, the tension…
 <br>
 For a pie.
 <br>
But that’s life in this city.
<br>
 Sometimes the answers are too absurd to be believable.
 <br>
 Sometimes the thief isn’t clever, isn’t careful, or isn't human at all.
<br>
 Valerie would be furious, sure.
 <br>
 And Revera… probably relieved.
 <br>
 But me?
 <br>
 I just shook my head.
 <br>
The city never stops surprising you.
<br>
 And neither do its dogs.
