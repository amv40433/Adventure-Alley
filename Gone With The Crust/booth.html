<h1>The Contest Booth</h1>
<p>The contest booth smelled of sugar, butter, and the unspoken disappointment of a thousand failed pies.
 Tables lined up like suspects in a lineup, each tin gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights except for Valerie’s empty, accusatory, impossible to ignore.
 <br>
I ran my eyes over the empty booth, imagining the scene the night before: pies lined up, judges asleep at their posts, a shadow slipping in and out without a sound.
 The room was too quiet.
  <br>
 Too sterile.
  <br>
 Like someone had rehearsed the theft, choreographed it, and left nothing behind.
  <br>
I traced the edges of the table, checking for crumbs, flour dust, anything to tell me the story the thief hadn’t wanted to tell.
 <br>
 Nothing.
  <br>
A faint smear here, a scuff mark there.
 <br>
 Tiny details, easy to miss, but they were there for someone trained to look.
  <br>
 The kind of details that speak louder than screams.
  <br>
The hall itself seemed to judge me as I worked.
 <br>
 Every polished floor tile reflected my reflection back at me, a tired, stubborn man chasing shadows.
  <br>
 And I could feel it: the thief had been here, confident, careful, untouchable.
    <br>
 I couldn’t see them, but I could feel the proof left behind in the atmosphere.
    <br>
 A crime, done perfectly, yet imperfect enough for me to start picking apart the lies.
