<h1>Mr. Revera</h1>
<p>The apparent culprit should’ve been Mr. Revera — Valerie’s arch nemesis.
<br>
 He’s won second place every year since Valerie started baking, and some men can only swallow so much defeat before they choke.
 <br>
But something about it felt too neat.
<br>
 Too clean.
 <br>
 <br>
 Revera didn’t strike me as the type to steal a pie.
 <br>
 Break a window? Sure.
 <br>
 Slash a tire? Maybe.
 <br>
 But pie theft?
 <br>
 That takes a different breed of desperation.
 <br>
So I took a walk down to his shop — “Revera’s Finest Pastries,” a name that always tasted bitter in Valerie’s mouth.
<br>
 The lights were off.
 <br>
 The blinds were drawn.
 <br>
 And the only thing greeting me at the door was the smell of burnt sugar and a “Closed Until Further Notice” sign that looked like it hadn’t moved in days.
<br>
<br>
 That’s when I felt it — the shift.
 <br>
 The case didn’t get simpler.
 <br>
 It got deeper.
 <br>
Someone wanted me to look at Revera.
<br>
 Someone wanted this wrapped fast, slapped with a bow, and tossed in the “open and shut” drawer.
 <br>
But the city doesn’t give out gifts without asking for something back.
<br>
And when I caught sight of the flour footprints leading away from Revera’s back door — footprints too small to belong to him,
I knew I wasn’t just dealing with a stolen pie.
<br>
No.
<br>
 This was something else.
 <br>
 Something with layers.
 <br>
Like a good pie.
<br>
 Or a bad lie.
 <br>
 Either way, I planned to cut right into it.</p>
