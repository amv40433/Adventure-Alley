The Cameras...
</p>
<p class="body"> 
The security cameras weren’t glamorous, just dusty lenses and blinking lights tucked into corners like silent, judgmental witnesses.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
I approached the monitor like a man approaching a confession, expecting nothing and hoping for everything.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
The feed flickered, black-and-white ghosts moving in slow, jerky rhythm.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
Frames captured the night: empty streets, closed shops, the contest booth in eerie silence.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
And then, 
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
There it was.
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
A shadow slipping past the booth. 
</p><br>
<p class="body">
Careful...
</p><br>
<p class="body2">
Deliberate...
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
I leaned back in my chair, eyes still locked on the monitor, cigarette glowing in the dim light.
</p><br>
<p class="body">
 The pie might’ve been stolen, the tin empty, but the truth?
</p><br>
<p class="body1">
The truth never hides for long.
</p> <br>
<p class="body">
 And tonight, it was finally showing itself.
