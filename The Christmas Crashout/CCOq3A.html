<strong>CAMREN:</strong>
<br>
Isn’t that your third divorce?
<br>
<br>
<em>(GRANDMA practically leaps out of her chair, waving her hands frantically.)</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>GRANDMA (screaming):</strong>
<br>
How dare you say that at my table?! That is the rudest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life! I cannot believe you!
<br>
<br>
<em>(The room erupts in chaos, and everyone begins talking over one another)</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN TINA (snapping, pointing at Camren):</strong>
<br>
See! This is exactly what I’m talking about!
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN DEREK (jumping up, furious):</strong>
<br>
Yeah! How can you just sit there and—
<br>
<br>
<strong>AUNT BRENDA (standing, voice high-pitched, slamming her hands):</strong>
<br>
Camren! That is entirely unacceptable! What has gotten into you!
<br>
<br>
<strong>MOTHER (gritting teeth, flailing hands, and getting everyonones attention):</strong>
<br>
Everyone! Everyone! Sit down! This is a dinner table, not a battlefield!
<br>
<br>
<strong>UNCLE (calm, slow, eyes on CAMREN):</strong>
<br>
He’s not wrong.
<br>
<br>
<em>
(The room freezes for a beat. Then chaos erupts louder than before. Shouts, gesturing, and finger-pointing fill the air.)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN TINA (yelling at UNCLE):</strong>
<br>
 Not wrong?! How can you say that?
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>COUSIN DEREK (to Camren, frantic):</strong>
<br>
 You can’t just say stuff like that!
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>AUNT BRENDA (glaring at UNCLE):</strong>
<br>
 Exactly! What is wrong with you?!
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>GRANDMA (gasping, clutching pearls again, frantic):</strong>
<br>
 I can’t believe this! This is disgraceful!
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>MOTHER (desperate, voice breaking):</strong>
<br>
 Camren… please… I think It's time for you to leave.
