<h1>The Christmas Crashout</h1>
<p>CAMREN:
Isn’t that your third divorce?
<br>
(GRANDMA practically leaps out of her chair, waving her hands frantically.)
<br>
GRANDMA (screaming):
 How dare you say that at my table?! That is the rudest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life! I cannot believe you!
 <br>
(The room erupts in chaos, and everyone begins talking over one another)
<br>
COUSIN TINA (snapping, pointing at Camren):
 See! This is exactly what I’m talking about!
 <br>
COUSIN DEREK (jumping up, furious):
 Yeah! How can you just sit there and—
 <br>
AUNT BRENDA (standing, voice high-pitched, slamming her hands):
 Camren! That is entirely unacceptable! What has gotten into you!
 <br>
MOTHER (gritting teeth, flailing hands, and getting everyonones attention):
 Everyone! Everyone! Sit down! This is a dinner table, not a battlefield!
 <br>
UNCLE (calm, slow, deadpan, eyes on CAMREN):
 He’s not wrong.
 <br>
(The room freezes for a beat. Then chaos erupts louder than before. Shouts, gesturing, and finger-pointing fill the air.)
<br>
COUSIN TINA (yelling at UNCLE):
 Not wrong?! How can you say that?
 <br>
COUSIN DEREK (to Camren, frantic):
 You can’t just say stuff like that!
 <br>
AUNT BRENDA (glaring at UNCLE):
 Exactly! What is wrong with you?!
 <br>
GRANDMA (gasping, clutching pearls again, frantic):
 I can’t believe this! This is disgraceful!
 <br>
MOTHER (desperate, voice breaking):
 Camren… please… I think It's time for you to leave. 
</p>

<li><a href="CCOq4.html">I think its time you worry about your eyebrows. </a></li>
