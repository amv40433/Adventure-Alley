<h1>The Christmas Crashout</h1>
<p>
CAMREN:When you finish having kids with baby daddy number six.
<br>
(Absolute silence. COUSINS’ jaws drop. MOTHER gasps, grabbing her napkin like she needs something to absorb the shock. GRANDMA clutches her pearls so hard they nearly snap. AUNT BRENDA’s eyes widen like she’s just seen a ghost.)
<br>
COUSIN DEREK (stammering, flustered): Wha… I—Camren! That’s—wow.
<br>
COUSIN TINA (outraged):How dare you—
<br>
(Before they can continue, UNCLE quietly clears his throat, low and calm.)
<br>
UNCLE: He’s not wrong.
<br>
(Everyone freezes. The room goes dead silent again. CAMREN calmly starts eating, letting the tension hang.)
<br>
MOTHER (clapping her hands nervously):
Okay! Alright, alright… Let’s just—let’s just eat, everyone. Potatoes, please. Yes, Derek, pass the gravy. Tina, don’t throw that roll at him. Ha ha… so, Camren, tell me about your classes! Any… interesting lectures?
<br>
COUSIN TINA (muttering):
Interesting… like Camren's life lessons?
<br>
MOTHER:
 Alright… okay, let’s just eat, everyone. Um… Camren, honey, tell me—do you have anyone special in your life these days?
 <br>
(CAMREN pauses, chewing thoughtfully. The family leans in slightly, interested.)
<br>
CAMREN:
 Well… there’s someone. But nothing official.
 <br>
MOTHER (smiling, trying to be casual):
 Oh? That’s nice! Tell me more—how did you meet? Are they in school too?
 <br>
GRANDMA (leaning forward, sweetly, a little oblivious):
 Oh, my! How wonderful. I do hope they’re a good girl for you, Camren… or a good boy! You know, I never met her, but I just know she must be a lovely person… and someday, when the time is right, maybe she’ll give me a little great-grandbaby to fuss over!
<br>
 (The family freezes slightly at the implication, but Grandma continues, innocently.)
GRANDMA (continuing, cheerful):
 Oh, I do get ahead of myself sometimes… but it’s just that I can’t wait to see you happy, dear.
 <br>
(Everyone laughs nervously. MOTHER nudges GRANDMA to calm her excitement.)
<br>
MOTHER:
 Mom, let’s not grill him too much. Just enjoy dinner, okay?
 <br>
AUNT BRENDA (leaning forward, genuinely curious, softening her tone):
You know, Grandma’s right… I’d really like to know more. Camren, this is important! I mean, you’re a wonderful young man, and I just want to see you happy. Who is this person you’re seeing? Do you two see a future together? Are you thinking long-term?
<br>
(CAMREN shifts slightly in his seat, feigning discomfort.)
<br>
CAMREN:
 Long-term… maybe. We’ll see.
 <br>
(A beat. GRANDMA nods approvingly, still oblivious to how forward she sounds.)
<br>
GRANDMA (sweetly, with a twinkle in her eye):
 Yes, yes… you must take good care of each other. I just hope she’s someone who makes you happy—and maybe, someday soon, gives this old lady a little great-grandchild to spoil! Im not getting any younger you know.
Exactly, Camren! You know we all care about you. You’re such a good man—you deserve a wonderful partner and a family of your own. The Lord knows this family could use a few more kids to liven things up. So… tell me, have you given any thought to when you might start planning for a little one—or two?
<br>
(CAMREN freezes, the room’s tension sharp again. UNCLE shifts slightly in his chair, subtly showing solidarity. CAMREN stares at the audience, resigned, bracing for impact.)
