<h1>The Christmas Crashout</h1>
<p>
CAMREN (deadpan):
When You Stop.
<br>
(Instant chaos. The table erupts and everyone begins talking over eachother.)
<br>
GRANDMA (clutching pearls, voice shrill):
 Oh heavens! That is rude! Who taught you manners, young man?!
 <br>
AUNT BRENDA (pointing a finger, glaring):
 Camren! That is absolutely unacceptable! I can’t believe you! How dare you!
 <br>
MOTHER (frantically waving hands, panicked):
 Alright! Everyone, please! Sit down, sit down! Let’s just eat! Derek! Stop glaring at him like that! Tina! Don’t Throw that bread roll!
<br>
 COUSIN TINA (standing, fists on hips, yelling):
 Wow! Really, Camren?! That’s what you’re going to say to us? After everything?!
 <br>
COUSIN DEREK (slamming his hand on the table):
 Unbelievable! I can’t… I just can’t! That is so disrespectful!
<br>
 (UNCLE quietly clears his throat, calm but deadly serious. The room goes momentarily silent )
 <br>
UNCLE:
He’s not wrong.
<br>
(CAMREN calmly continues eating, eyes on the audience. The family erupts again immediately after.)
<br>
GRANDMA (voice quivering, angry but still innocent):
 Oh, Camren! I just… I can’t! How dare you talk like that about your poor, tired family! I’ve worked hard raising all of you, and this is the thanks I get?
<br>
 AUNT BRENDA (slamming her hand on the table, voice high-pitched with fury):
 Exactly! Camren, you’re impossible! How dare you! I mean… I just wanted to know when you’re going to have kids, and this is how you answer me?!
<br>
 MOTHER (gritting teeth, panicked, waving hands wildly):
 Everyone! Stop! Just… just breathe. Potatoes, green beans, gravy! Can we focus on dinner for one second?! Alright, everyone, let’s… let’s just focus on eating, okay? Pass the mashed potatoes, yes… Derek, not like that, gently! Tina, don’t roll your eyes at your uncle!
<br>
 COUSIN TINA (snapping):
Oh, please! I can roll my eyes wherever I want!
<br>
(CAMREN silently loads a second plate, piling it generously while the argument escalates.)
<br>
MOTHER (voice strained, trying to regain control):
 Okay, okay! Let’s just… chew and swallow, everyone. Maybe… maybe think nice thoughts?
 <br>
COUSIN TINA (rolling eyes, muttering):
 Nice thoughts, sure… while Camren eats like it’s a competitive sport.
 <br>
CAMREN (pauses for a split second, giving the audience a silent, deadpan look, then quietly digs in on his second plate.)
<br>
COUSIN DEREK (snapping at Tina):
 Don’t look at him! Let him eat! Maybe if you focused on your own food…
 <br>
AUNT BRENDA (glaring at Derek):
 Oh, hush! You’re no saint yourself!
 <br>
GRANDMA (frowning, muttering to herself):
 Honestly, the nerve of this family…
 <br>
(The table falls silent, and the family awkwardly continues eating in silence. CAMREN silently finishes his second plate aside, looking almost contemplative, then begins loading a third plate.)
<br>
GRANDMA (squinting, voice rising in shock and disbelief):
 Isn’t… that your third plate of food?!
 <br>
(The room freezes. Everyone stops mid-bite, mid-chew. Utter silence, except for the faint sound of CAMREN putting a forkful into his mouth. All eyes on him.)
