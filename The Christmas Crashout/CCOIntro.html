<em>
(Lights snap up. Enter CAMREN from stage right, disheveled, exhausted, wearing a wrinkled red button-down that’s seen better centuries. His backpack hangs off one shoulder by a single, barely-alive strap. He trudges to center stage and faces the audience.)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>CAMREN:</strong>
<br>
You don’t know me, but my name is Camren and I have just made the unfortunate, catastrophic, borderline idiotic mistake of going home for Christmas.
While most college students get to go home and relax after another brutal semester, watch movies with their siblings, drink cocoa, have a nice peaceful dinner, I get the honor of spending time with the Johnsons. Also known as… my family.
And while all of you get to eat your stupid ham and drink your stupid hot chocolate while you open your stupid Christmas presents, I will be getting interrogated by the CIA, also known as my family.
See, as the youngest and the only child, everyone has decided my life is an open-mic night for invasive questions. It’s been the same routine for four years now.
<br>
<br>
<em>(mocking voice)</em>
<br>
 <br>
 “Are you ever going to finish school?”
 <br>
 “When am I getting grandchildren?”
 <br>
 “Don’t you think you’ve eaten enough food? You’re going to get fat!”
 <br>
NO, BRENDA, I have not eaten enough food yet because this is the first real meal I’ve had since SEPTEMBER!
<br>
<br>
<em>(He pauses, breathes, smooths his shirt ineffectively.)</em>
<br>
<br>
This Christmas, though? I have a plan. A Christmas gift to myself, if you will. No more getting bulldozed by their comments. Does anyone have something slick to say?
<br>
<br>
<em>(He smiles slowly.)</em>
<br>
<br>
 I’ve got something even slicker.
<br>
By the end of tonight, the Johnson women will think twice before crossing me ever again.
<br>
<br>
