<em>
(Lights rise on a cozy, slightly chaotic dining room. A table overflowing with food sits center stage. MOTHER, AUNT BRENDA, GRANDMA, COUSINS TINA (30s) and DEREK (late 20s), and a quiet UNCLE are bustling around, getting ready to sit. CAMREN enters from stage right, backpack slung off one shoulder.)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>MOTHER:</strong>
<br>
There’s my baby boy! Come in, come in, perfect timing. We’re just about to sit down.
<br>
<br>
<em>
(She hugs him a little too tightly. CAMREN flinches, then follows her to the table. The COUSINS are already seated, smirking, elbows on the table. UNCLE sits quietly at the end, observing but mostly silent.AUNT BRENDA and GRANDMA are conversing between themselves)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN TINA (30s, mischievous, leaning forward):</strong>
<br>
Well, well, well… if it isn’t the prodigal scholar. How’s dorm life, Camren?
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN DEREK (late 20s, grinning, elbowing Tina):</strong>
<br>
 Yeah, tell us, buddy… do they even feed you there, or are you surviving on instant ramen and tears?
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>CAMREN:</strong>
<br>
Mostly tears. And regret.
<br>
<br>
<em>
(COUSINS and CAMREN laugh.)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN TINA (smirking, leaning closer):</strong>
<br>
 So… we heard about your roommate situation. Is it true he’s been stealing your laundry?
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>CAMREN (smirking slightly):</strong>
<br>
Only the socks that are too sad to continue living.
<br>
<br>
<em>
(Everyone chuckles. The mood is light until TINA leans forward with a grin, clearly gearing up for a jab.)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>COUSIN TINA:</strong>
<br>
Seriously though, Camren… You've been gone for ages. When are you finally going to finish school? 
<br>
<br>
<em>
(CAMREN freezes mid-bite. The room goes quiet. Lights dim slightly as CAMREN stares at the audience, the “here we go” look spreading across his face.)
