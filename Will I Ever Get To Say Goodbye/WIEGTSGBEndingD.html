<h1 class="chapter">Chapter 4</h1>
<br><br><br><br>
<p class="body">
Very carefully, I opened the door to find Elijah standing on the other side, dressed in his Army uniform. His duffel bag rested on the floor beside his feet.
</p>
<p class="body">
“What are you doing here?” I asked, confused, and, honestly, relieved to see a familiar face in the dark hallway.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I got some bad news,” he said quietly. “There was an issue at the base I was assigned to. My deployment date was suddenly moved up.”
</p>
<p class="body">
“It’s almost eleven o’clock at night,” I said, still confused, now a little irritated. “This couldn’t wait until tomorrow?”
</p>
<p class="body">
“No, Adelyne. It couldn’t.”
</p>
<p class="body">
The sharpness in his voice startled me, but the anger wasn’t directed at me, it was fear.
</p>
<p class="body">
A wave of sadness washed over him. His shoulders slumped, and he stared at the floor like he was scared to look at me.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I’m leaving tonight,” he said softly. “I’m here to say goodbye.”
</p>
<p class="body">
Tears stung the back of my eyes. I’d dreaded this moment every day since he first told me he was leaving. First, I thought we had all the time in the world; then I clung to the idea of the few weeks we still had left. Now, suddenly, I had minutes. Minutes before he became a memory I wouldn’t get to touch again for a long, long time.
</p>
<p class="body">
My spiraling thoughts broke when Elijah reached out and took my hands, pulling me gently toward him. His grip trembled.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, still staring at the floor.
</p>
<p class="body">
I leaned my forehead against his, trying to absorb every last bit of warmth from him before he slipped away into a world I couldn’t follow. After a long moment, he lifted my chin so our eyes could meet. His eyes were red, glassy, and breaking.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I promise I’ll write to you every day,” he said, his voice soft, with the faintest hint of a smile meant just for me.
</p>
<p class="body">
He let go of one of my hands and reached into his pocket with a shakiness I’d never seen in him before. His breath caught, and for a moment he just stood there, like he was trying to gather the courage for something that hurt to even think about.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Here,” he said finally, barely more than a whisper.
</p>
<p class="body">
I opened my hand, and he placed a small gold disk into my palm. His fingers lingered against my skin for a second longer than necessary, like letting go of the object meant letting go of something bigger.
</p>
<p class="body">
The letters EJH were engraved across the top, worn at the edges as if he’d carried it for years.
</p>
<p class="body">
“It’s my compass,” he said, his voice cracking just enough to break my heart. He pressed a tiny button on the side, and it clicked open gently, revealing its trembling needle. “My dad gave it to me when I enlisted. I’ve taken it everywhere.”
</p>
<p class="body">
I felt my breath catch. “Elijah… you don’t have to give me this.”
</p>
<p class="body">
“I know,” he murmured, lifting his eyes to mine. They were shining now, raw and earnest. “But I need you to have it.”
</p>
<p class="body">
He swallowed hard, like the words were lodged somewhere deep.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I want you to hold onto it until I come home.”
</p>
<p class="body">
I blinked back tears, clutching it carefully, like it was made of something sacred.
</p>
<p class="body">
Then, with the softest, most devastating smile, he added:
</p>
<p class="body">
“So when things get hard, or lonely, or confusing… you’ll remember that no matter where I am in the world, I’ll always find my way back to you.”
</p>
<p class="body">
The line hit me like a physical ache, so tender and certain, it made my knees weaken. His voice wavered at the end, as if he was saying it more to convince himself than me.
</p>
<p class="body">
I pressed the compass to my chest. “Elijah…” was all I could manage.
</p>
<p class="body">
He reached up and brushed a tear off my cheek with his thumb, his hand warm and trembling. And in that moment, standing there in our dim hallway, with the weight of the goodbyes we didn’t want to say pressing in around us, I knew that compass was more than a gift.
</p>
<p class="body">
It was a promise.
</p>
<p class="body">
I pulled him into a hug, tight, desperate, the kind you wish you could freeze in time.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Thank you,” I whispered against his shoulder. “I’ll keep it safe. I promise.”
</p>
<p class="body">
When we finally separated, I wiped away a stray tear trailing down my cheek. Elijah turned toward his bag, reached for it, then stopped. He looked back at me.
</p>
<p class="body">
Our eyes locked. Our faces leaned in.
</p>
<p class="body">
Slowly, carefully, he closed the small distance between us.
</p>
<p class="body">
His lips met mine.
</p>
<p class="body">
Soft. Warm. Certain.
</p>
<p class="body">
He pulled me closer, and for a single suspended moment, everything felt right, his body against mine, his breath, his hands, the kiss I’d been waiting for since the night he first knocked on my door.
</p>
<p class="body">
And then it was gone.
</p>
<p class="body">
He stepped back with one last lingering look. I watched him pick up his duffel bag and walk toward the elevator, the same elevator where this whole journey began.
</p>
<p class="body">
I stood in my doorway, holding his compass, and whispered a quiet goodbye as the elevator doors closed between us.
