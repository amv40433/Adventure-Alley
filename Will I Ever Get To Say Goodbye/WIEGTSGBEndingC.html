I never ended up opening the door that night, and I wish I had.
</p>
<p class="body">
The next morning, I left for work earlier than usual. I unlocked my door, swung it open, and froze.
</p>
<p class="body">
There, sitting neatly on the floor outside my apartment, was a folded note with <em>To: Adelyne</em> written on the front in Elijah’s handwriting.
</p>
<p class="body">
Resting on top of it was a small gold disk.
</p>
<p class="body">
I knelt and picked it up. The disk fit perfectly in my palm, cool, smooth, and heavier than it looked. Three letters were engraved across the top: E J H.
</p>
<p class="body">
As I turned it over, something tiny on the side caught my eye, a button. I pressed it, and with a soft click, the disk opened to reveal a small compass. Its needle trembled gently before settling toward the north.
</p>
<p class="body">
Confused and with a knot forming in my stomach, I stepped back inside my apartment. I shut the door, sat on the arm of my couch, and unfolded the note with shaky fingers.

<em>Dear Adelyne,
</p>
<p class="body">
I’m sorry to have to tell you this in a letter, but I didn’t know any other way.
</p>
<p class="body">
I tried knocking last night, I’m guessing you were already asleep by the time I came by.
</p>
<p class="body">
I got a call from my commander yesterday afternoon. There was an issue at the base I’m deploying to, and they needed me sooner than expected. My deployment date got moved up. I wanted to stop by sooner, but I had to pack and make sure everything was squared away.
</p>
<p class="body">
I left for base late last night. By the time you read this, I’ll probably be on a plane heading overseas.
</p>
<p class="body">
I’m sorry I didn’t get the chance to say goodbye correctly. It breaks my heart to leave like this. I promise I’ll write you every chance I get.
</p>
<p class="body">
Thank you for being so kind to me. For being an incredible neighbor. For being… you.
</p>
<p class="body">
I hope we’ll stay in touch, because more than anything, I hope we get the chance, someday, to be more than friends.
</p>
<p class="body">
I should’ve told you that sooner. I should’ve told you the night I walked out of your apartment after dinner. I wanted to kiss you so badly I could barely breathe. I’ve wanted to hold you every night we fell asleep watching movies on your couch. I’ve wanted to take your hand on all our walks, and I know you wanted those things too.
</p>
<p class="body">
I promise: when I come home, we’ll have all the moments we didn’t get to have.
</p>
<p class="body">
As you’ve probably already noticed, I left my compass for you. My dad gave it to me when I enlisted. I’ve taken it everywhere. I want you to hold onto it until I come home.
</p>
<p class="body">
So when things get hard, or lonely, or confusing… you’ll remember that no matter where I am in the world, I’ll always find my way back to you.
</p>
<p class="body">
With much love,
</p>
<p class="body">
Elijah J. Henderson
