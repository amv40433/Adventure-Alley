<h1>Will I Ever Get to Say Goodbye?</h1>
<p class="body">When Adelyn moves into her new apartment, she’s expecting a 
fresh start not an unexpected connection. Then she meets him: 
her mysterious, kind, impossibly charming neighbor who seems to 
carry a heavy sadness behind his smile. What she doesn’t know is 
that his time is running out, and everything between them is unfolding
against the ticking clock of fate. As Adelyn grows closer to him, you’ll
guide her choices whether she pushes forward, pulls away, or uncovers truths 
she never saw coming. Your decisions may give her the chance to say goodbye… or
leave her with a heartbreak she never prepared for.</p>
