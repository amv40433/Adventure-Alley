<h1>Will I Ever Get to Say Goodbye?</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>
“I don’t know what you’re doing later, but if you’re free around 6:30… you’re welcome to join me for dinner. If you’d like,” I said, my voice sounding braver than I felt.
<br>
His face lit up instantly. “I would love to,” he said, a little too quickly, then laughed. “You’ve got me hungry for that chicken already.”
<br>

<br>
<br>
At 6:30 on the dot, there was a knock at my door. When I opened it, Elijah stood there wearing a nervous-but-excited smile that mirrored exactly how I felt.
<br>
“Come on in,” I said, trying not to sound thrilled.
<br>
“I brought some wine,” he said as he stepped inside. “I didn’t know if you were a red or white person, so… I brought both.”
<br>
The rest of the night unfolded like something out of a dream.
<br>
The chicken came out perfectly.
<br>
The wine paired with it as we’d planned.
<br>
And Elijah and I talked for hours—far past the point where time should have mattered. It felt like we had known each other our whole lives.
<br>
It was nearly 1 a.m. when we finally realized how late it had gotten.
<br>
“Well, I should probably head out,” he said, sounding genuinely disappointed. “I have work in the morning.”
<br>
“Me too,” I replied.
<br>
He gathered his things, and I walked him to the door.
<br>
“I had a really great time tonight,” he said softly.
<br>
When our eyes met, something shifted—like the world went quiet just for the two of us. His eyes looked especially warm in the faint glow of the hallway light.
<br>
“I did too… We should do it again sometime,” I said.
<br>
He nodded, smiling, and our eyes held for a moment too long—one of those moments where you’re both hoping the other person will close the distance. He stepped just a fraction closer, close enough that I felt the warmth of him, and for a heartbeat, I thought he was going to kiss me.
<br>
But the moment flickered out.
<br>
He stepped back with a gentle, “Goodnight,”
<br>
And then he was gone.
<br>

<br>
After that night, we started seeing each other constantly. We never defined anything or made plans that sounded like dates, but we were always… together.
<br>
Saturday mornings on his balcony, drinking coffee while the sun climbed over the buildings.
<br>
Movies on the couch after long workdays.
<br>
He comes over for dinner almost every Sunday.
<br>
The more time I spent with him, the more I realized how deeply I wanted him—his presence, his laugh, his quiet steadiness. I wanted to thread my fingers through his thick curls, hold his hand while we walked through the city, curl up against him on cold, rainy nights while we watched our favorite shows.
<br>
And I knew, deep down, he wanted that too. I saw it in the way his shoulders relaxed when I walked into a room, in the softness of his smile, in the way he always lingered near me—as if he was fighting the same pull I was.
<br>
But something held him back.
<br>
Something he hadn’t told me.
<br>

<br>
On a crisp autumn morning, we were walking through the city park, leaves crunching under our shoes, when his voice shifted.
<br>
“I have to be honest about something,” he said quietly. “I’ve been keeping a secret from you.”
<br>
I stopped walking. “Okay…?”
<br>
“I never told you, but I’m in the Army Reserves.”
<br>
“Oh.” I blinked. “Alright. I mean… that’s fine?”
<br>
“There’s more.” He exhaled hard. “About six months ago—right before I met you—I re-signed my contract. I decided to go on active duty.”
<br>
My stomach tightened. “What does that… mean?”
<br>
“It means in a few weeks, I’m leaving for a deployment overseas.”
<br>
The words hit me like a freight train.
<br>
Suddenly, everything made sense—the hesitation, the tension, the little walls he kept between us.
<br>
A part of me burned with anger that he hadn’t told me.
<br>
Another part burned at me for acting like we had endless days ahead, that our quiet routines would last forever.
<br>
And beneath all of that, strangely, was relief—relief that I’d gotten to experience these months with him without the shadow of an expiration date.
<br>

<br>
Late one night, as I was getting ready for bed, an unexpected pounding rattled my door. Not a soft knock—an urgent, rapid one that sent a jolt through my spine.
<br>
Startled, I peered through the broken peephole, trying to make sense of the warped silhouette on the other side. I froze.
<br>
As a single woman living alone, opening the door to a faceless figure in the middle of the night felt like the beginning of a horror movie. My pulse quickened.
<br>
But the only person who ever knocked on my door these days was Elijah.
<br>
Still… why would he be here this late?
<br>
And why would he be knocking like that?
<br>
I swallowed hard, hand hovering just above the lock, unsure if opening the door was the biggest mistake I could make—or the only choice I had.
