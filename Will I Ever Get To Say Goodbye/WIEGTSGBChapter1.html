<p class="body">I’ll never forget the first time I saw him. He was walking past me in the hallway of the apartment building I had just moved into. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with short curls the color of coal. Our eyes didn’t meet. He just walked out the doors as I stepped into the elevator, but somehow, that fleeting moment stayed with me.
</p>
<p class="body">
Weeks passed, and I didn’t see him again. Eventually, I convinced myself to stop thinking about it, to stop wondering who he was. But then, one morning, I saw him, standing by the elevator doors, waiting. The same elevator I was about to take.
</p>
<p class="body">
The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime. He glanced up when he saw me approach. For a second, I almost forgot how to move. Then I stepped inside, and the doors closed behind us with a low hum.
</p>
<p class="body">
The air felt different in that small space, thicker somehow. I could hear my own heartbeat, feel the weight of the silence stretching between us. He smelled faintly of rain and laundry soap.
</p>
<p class="body">
The elevator hummed softly as it began to move. I glanced at the glowing numbers overhead, pretending to care which floor we were on, even though I already knew.
</p>
<p class="body">
The silence was unbearable. He stood beside me, tall and calm, his reflection flickering faintly against the brushed-metal walls.
</p>
<p class="body">
I begin battling with myself, wondering if I should continue to pretend like I don't notice him or if I should say hello and introduce myself.
