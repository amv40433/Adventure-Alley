<p class="body">
As the elevator bell chimed and the doors slid open, I realized I’d been so tangled in my own thoughts that I hadn’t noticed we were getting off on the same floor.
</p>
<p class="body">
In a moment of sheer panic, I managed to squeak out, “Hey,” my voice sounding braver than I felt. “I think I’ve seen you around here before. Do you live on this floor too?”
</p>
<p class="body">
He looked over, surprised at first, then smiled, a small, quiet smile that made my chest feel a little too tight.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Yeah,” he said. “Apartment 3F. You?”
</p>
<p class="body">
“3B,” I replied. “Guess we’re neighbors.”
</p>
<p class="body">
“Guess so,” he said, still smiling.
</p>
<p class="body">
We both stepped out of the elevator, walking in the same direction down the hall.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I’m Elijah, by the way,” he said as he reached his door.
</p>
<p class="body">
“I’m Adelyne,” I answered.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Nice to meet you.”
</p>
<p class="body">
Then he disappeared inside, and I was left standing in the hallway, the soft click of his door echoing somewhere deep in my chest.
</p>
<p class="body">
The days after that elevator ride felt… different. Maybe it was nothing, but every time I walked down the hallway, I found myself glancing at 3F, half expecting the door to open.
</p>
<p class="body">
It didn’t. Not at first.
</p>
<p class="body">
Then one morning, I saw him again in the mailroom. He was holding a bundle of letters, a half-open envelope caught between his fingers. He looked up when I walked in.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Hey, 3B,” he said, smiling like we’d been neighbors for years.
</p>
<p class="body">
I smiled back. “Hey, 3F.”
</p>
<p class="body">
We talked about the mail constantly getting mixed up, about how the elevator made strange noises at night. He had this calm, steady way of talking, like every word had a soft place to land.
</p>
<p class="body">
After that, it just… kept happening.
</p>
<p class="body">
In the laundry room.
</p>
<p class="body">
The lobby.
</p>
<p class="body">
The tiny courtyard out back, where the ivy was turning brown.
</p>
<p class="body">
Always brief. Always easy.
</p>
<p class="body">
But the more I saw him, the more I wanted to actually know him, beyond the polite neighbor smiles and passing jokes.
</p>
<br>
<p class="body">-----</p>

<p class="body">
One Sunday afternoon, I was lugging my groceries out of the elevator when I heard the click of a door opening. I looked up to see him stepping out of his apartment.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Hey, stranger,” I joked. “Where are you off to?”
</p>
<p class="body">
“Just going out for a jog,” he said. “What are you making?” He nodded toward the bags in my arms.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Broasted chicken and asparagus.” I lifted one bag for emphasis.
</p>
<p class="body">
We chatted for a bit, light, easy conversation before he signaled it was time for him to head out. I knew our little neighborly moment was ending, yet every part of me wanted it to continue.
</p>
<p class="body">
I wanted to invite him over for dinner. Growing up, my family was always close with our neighbors, people in and out of each other’s houses without a second thought, but this was different. This was an apartment building. This was… him.
</p>
<p class="body">
And I didn’t want to make anything weird.
