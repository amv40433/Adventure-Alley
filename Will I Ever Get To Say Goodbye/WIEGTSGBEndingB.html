As much as I liked him, I didn’t want him to think I had some ulterior motive. I genuinely just wanted to know him better. So I told myself I’d wait. Wait until he said something, or until we crossed paths a few more times.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Well, enjoy your run,” I said, forcing myself to turn toward my door.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Enjoy your chicken,” he replied with a smile that lingered even after he left.
</p>

After that afternoon, I ran into Elijah a few more times. Our conversations were short but pleasant. I never worked up the courage to ask him to hang out, and he never mentioned anything either.
</p>
<p class="body">
Slowly, our encounters became less frequent.
</p>
<p class="body">
Then, eventually, they stopped.
</p>

It was a Monday afternoon when I saw a moving truck outside the building and a young couple carrying boxes into the elevator.
</p>
<p class="body">
I held the doors open for them as they loaded their belongings in.
</p>
<p class="body">
“What floor?” I asked.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Three,” the young man replied.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Hey! That’s my floor,” I said brightly. “We must be neighbors. Welcome to the building!”
</p>
<p class="body">
“Thanks!” the woman said. “I’m Jenna, and this is my husband, Miles.”
</p>
<p class="body">
“Nice to meet you! I’m Adelyne, 3B. What apartment are you two moving into?”
</p>
<p class="body">
“Apartment 3F,” Miles replied.
</p>
<p class="body">
The words hit harder than they should have.
</p>
<p class="body">
Just like that… Elijah was gone.
</p>
<p class="body">
No wonder I hadn’t seen him.
</p>
<p class="body">
The elevator bell chimed, and the doors opened, interrupting my spiraling thoughts.
</p>
<p class="body">
“Well, good luck with the move,” I said politely. “Hope to see you around.”
</p>
<p class="body">
I didn’t mean that. Not really.
</p>
<p class="body">
I never knew Elijah well, and I’m disappointed, maybe more than I should be, that I never got the chance to know him beyond those passing, neighborly moments. I never figured out what happened to him, or where he ended up, but I hope he’s doing well.
</p>
<p class="body">
I still think about him sometimes, about that Sunday, about the dinner I didn’t invite him to, about the courage I didn’t have.
</p>
<p class="body">
Maybe we could have been friends.
</p>
<p class="body">
Maybe something more.
</p>
<p class="body">
All I know is that he’s gone now, and I never got the chance to say goodbye.
