<h1>Will I Ever Get to Say Goodbye?</h1>
<p>
As much as I liked him, I didn’t want him to think I had some ulterior motive. I genuinely just wanted to know him better. So I told myself I’d wait—wait until he said something, or until we crossed paths a few more times.
<br>
“Well, enjoy your run,” I said, forcing myself to turn toward my door.
<br>
“Enjoy your chicken,” he replied with a smile that lingered even after he jogged off.
<br>
After that afternoon, I ran into Elijah a few more times. Our conversations were short but pleasant. I never worked up the courage to ask him to hang out, and he never mentioned anything either.
<br>
Slowly, our encounters became less frequent.
<br>
Then, eventually, they stopped.
<br>
It was a Monday afternoon when I saw a moving truck outside the building and a young couple carrying boxes into the elevator.
<br>
I held the doors open for them as they loaded their belongings in.
<br>
“What floor?” I asked.
<br>
“Three,” the young man replied.
<br>
“Hey! That’s my floor,” I said brightly. “We must be neighbors. Welcome to the building!”
<br>
“Thanks!” the woman said. “I’m Jenna, and this is my husband, Miles.”
<br>
“Nice to meet you! I’m Adelyne—3B. What apartment are you two moving into?”
<br>
“Apartment 3F,” Miles replied.
<br>
The words hit harder than they should have.
<br>
Just like that… Elijah was gone.
<br>
No wonder I hadn’t seen him.
<br>
The elevator bell chimed, and the doors opened, interrupting my spiraling thoughts.
<br>
“Well, good luck with the move,” I said politely. “Hope to see you around.”
<br>
I didn’t mean that. Not really.
<br>
I never knew Elijah well, and I’m disappointed—maybe more than I should be—that I never got the chance to know him beyond those passing, neighborly moments. I never figured out what happened to him, or where he ended up, but I hope he’s doing well.
<br>
I still think about him sometimes—about that Sunday, about the dinner I didn’t invite him to, about the courage I didn’t have.
<br>
Maybe we could have been friends.
<br>
Maybe something more.
<br>
All I know is that he’s gone now, and I never got the chance to say goodbye.
