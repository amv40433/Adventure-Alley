I decided not to say anything. I kept my eyes on the glowing elevator numbers and pretended this was just another ordinary ride. When the doors opened on my floor, I stepped out, and he walked one way while I walked the other, like two lines crossing just once before pulling apart again.
</p>
<p class="body">
After that morning, I saw him a handful of times, quick, passing moments in the lobby or at the mailboxes, but never long enough, never at the right time. Every time I stepped into the elevator, a small part of me hoped he’d appear beside me, just so I’d finally have an excuse to say hello. He never did.
</p>
<p class="body">
Eventually, I stopped seeing him altogether. Maybe he moved out. Maybe he’d only been visiting someone. Maybe our little near-moment was all it was ever meant to be.
</p>
<p class="body">
Sometimes I still think about him, though, about that day in the elevator and the words I never said. I wonder who he was, what his laugh sounded like… whether we could have been something. I guess I’ll never know.
